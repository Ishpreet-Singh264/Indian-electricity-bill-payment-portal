              <h2>Save Electrictiy, Save Environment</h2>
              <h5>Conserving electrictiy can have a positive impact on the environment. Here are some tips to reduce power consumption.</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><h4>Switch off when not in use.</h4></li>
                Did you know: Your electronic appliances use as much as 75% of their electricity consumption when switched off?

A simple tour of your home will likely prove you have at least several plugged-in items you’re not using. For example, electrical items on standby, such as TV’s, computers and video games consoles. Many of these appliances draw a small amount of electricity whilst waiting for use
                <br>
                <br>
               <li><h4>Use large appliances together to reduce energy use</h4></li>
               Whereas your modern washing machine and dryer may be marked energy-efficient, even energy efficient appliances still consume a lot of electricity with each use.

To conserve electricity as much as possible, pool your laundry together (as a family or roommates) and do full loads all at once. As a result, you cut down on the number of times you end up using the washer every week. If it helps, think about how much money you’re throwing away with each wash of an item or two. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><h4>Install energy-efficient light bulbs</h4></li>
                Talking lighting, another great substitute is to swap incandescent lights for a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) or led bulbs. CFLs use between 50-80% less energy than regular incandescent bulbs.

You’ll find these more expensive to purchase at first than regular bulbs, which use more energy. But, they will last a lot longer than the regular ones. As a result, over time, the cost balances out as you save more energy. CFLs are especially practical for exterior lighting, which you may require left on throughout the night.
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><h4>Stay up to date on maintenance to save energy</h4></li>
                Your appliances will work more effectively and save you electricity at home if they are cared for. For example, when your air conditioner air filters clog up, you might choose to turn it up higher because the regular temperature doesn’t do so much anymore, using more energy.

By changing the filter (monthly, as recommended), you can get enough cold air at a minimal temperature, and you’ll note a reduction in your utility bills. The same applies to your dishwasher, tumble dryer, and other appliances.
